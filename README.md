# Simplified Analog Clock Reading: Mastering Time Classification

In a world where everyone is dependent on digital timekeeping, the ability to effortlessly understand analog clocks connects us to the past but at the same time empowers us in the present. 

Mastering time classification is a task where it can be useful for us especially in a subject-matter time domain and applications. The goal of the analog clock image time classification is to know or identify the time that is being indicated by the analog clock.

> This project is for simplifying analog clock reading by using an image classification model through streamlit.

## Test Sample.py

This python file tests some of the functionalities of the application. Currently, it includes testing of image loading and classes loading of the application. In the next update it will contain testing of multiple machin

## Features:

### Home Page:

This part is where you can see the title of the website itself, the short description, and what is the purpose of the website which is to classify analog time to its corresponding digital time.

### Classification Page:

This part is where we deployed a time classification model, if an image has been inputted it will classify the corresponding digital time and will show the output results.

### About Page:

This part is where you can see the different types of classification algorithms that you can use in benchmarking.

Each feature has been added in its function to simplify its execution. It provides information on the best architectures for classification in deep learning. It will be used as a benchmarking reference.


## Reflection:

In this project, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the CI/CD process as we created each part of the web application. We also learned how to use GitHub in order to efficiently coordinate changes and updates we have made to the codes and components that make up the web application. Some of the difficulties we encountered is the lack of communication when we started to create and do our assigned tasks. We were only able to communicate with each other whenever we had downtime in the task we were doing and whenever we committed changes to our repository. Overall, the experience we had helped in developing our skills to work with people remotely and be able to communicate as clearly and concisely due to the limited windows of time from being busy doing our part. Our understanding and knowledge of implementing CI/CD in deploying web applications also improved as well as our skills in front-end development, machine learning and documentation.
