# Simplified Analog Clock Reading: Mastering Time Classification

In a world where everyone is dependent on digital timekeeping, the ability to effortlessly understand analog clocks connects us to the past but at the same time empowers us in the present. This project is designed to automate reading analog clocks with the goal of being accessible and understandable. We aim to make an easier and clearer way to understand analog clock reading in this project while also providing the knowledge and skills to classify time.

Mastering time classification is a task where it can be useful for us especially in a subject-matter time domain and applications. The goal of the analog clock image time classification is to know or identify the time that is being indicated by the analog clock. 

This project is for simplifying analog clock reading by using an image classification model through streamlit.

## Test Sample.py

This part is where you can load, import, predict, and test your model to check that the code produces results that are expected.

## Features:

###Home Page:

This part is where you can see the title of the website itself, the short description, and what is the purpose of the website which is to classify analog time to its corresponding digital time.

###Classification Page:

This part is where we deployed a time classification model, if an image has been inputted it will classify the corresponding digital time and will show the output results.
